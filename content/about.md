**Lispy Snake, Ltd.** is a brand new software development company, estabilished in the UK, 2019.
We approach software development from a unique angle, building on many, many years of experience.
This should reflect through in our upcoming releases, so keep your eyes peeled.

#### Contracting

We're happy to undertake contract work to help you solve your problems quicker. We have the in-house
talent to approach software engineering from a unique perspective, which is far more cost and time
effective than building new skills and teams internally.

#### Open Source

There are times you really don't need to reinvent the wheel, only reduce the surface friction. With that
in mind we use and develop open source software, eliminating technical debt from your projects.

**Did you know** .. this website is open source, and made using F/OSS components? Check our [{{<fontawesome fab fa-github>}} GitHub]({{<param SocialGithub>}}) repository!

#### Games

As well as developing gaming software, we build games on top of it. We're big believers in eating our own dogfood.
From time to time we make these games publicly available, with our first public 2D title in the works already.


#### Expertise

Our company is dedicated to staying on the leading-edge of software engineering practices, challenging the
industry norms on a daily basis. Notably, we're experts in **modern C development**, [Golang](https://golang.org/) applications
and [Python](https://www.python.org/) services. We also have extensive experience in low level [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/) engineering, from
toolchain bootstrap all the way up to the desktop.

We specialise in the following:

 - Linux distribution engineering
 - Django services + sites
 - Site scalability
 - Cloud
 - Microservice architecture
 - Back-office development
 - Backend engineering
 - Data Processing
