Lispy Snake, Ltd. is a new breed of software engineering company, established in 2019 in the UK.
We're determined to apply a new approach to software development, one that questions estabilished
"norms" in the industry. Using our extensive experience, we can help you make the best decisions
for your software business.

#### F/OSS Friendly

We're huge believers in Free and/or Open Source Software, seeking to reuse and improve F/OSS components
wherever possible. Additionally, we require that reusable components and tools developed as part of our
contractual work for customers be open sourced for use by the wider community.

**Did you know** .. this website is open source, and made using F/OSS components? Check our [GitHub](https://github.com/lispysnake/website) repository!

#### Mission

Our core imperative is to provide contracting services to small & medium sized businesses. As a result we can
save your company money by lending our expertise and skills instead of you having to grow in-house talent
to meet the next challenge. In a nutshell, we'll stay ahead of the curve so you don't have to. When time to market
is critical, don't be left behind.

Additionally, when we create commercial software, we will always seek to open source the project for the
benefit of the wider community. This will usually happen once the required revenue target has been hit. This will allow
us to develop alternative streams of revenue for the company during growth phases, with the goal of giving back to the
community at the earliest moment possible.
