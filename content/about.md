Lispy Snake, Ltd. is a new breed of indie game studio, established in 2019 in the UK.
We approach software development from a unique angle, building on many, many years of experience.
This should reflect through in our upcoming titles, so keep your eyes peeled.


#### F/OSS Friendly

We're huge believers in Free and/or Open Source Software, seeking to reuse and improve F/OSS components
wherever possible. As we develop components required for our games, we'll open source them for the benefit
of the wider community. <3

**Did you know** .. this website is open source, and made using F/OSS components? Check our [{{<fontawesome fab fa-github>}} GitHub](https://github.com/lispysnake/website) repository!

#### Coming Soon

We're in the very first stages of startup, while an international team is being assembled.
With that said, we can at least confirm that engine prototyping and storyboarding is under way for our first title.
