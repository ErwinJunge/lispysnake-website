We've been working around the clock here at Lispy Snake HQ. To that end, we've brought about a load
of engine improvements. Currently we now have sprite animations, scrolling backgrounds, entity
states, irregular tile support, and much more.

### What's Left To Do... Engine-near?

In terms of reaching our first technical demos, we basically need to finish the following:

 - Controller Hookup (I pressed a thing. Do a thing. Almost done.)
 - Better internal batching (future Vulkan readiness as well as interleaved z-indexes)
 - Some kinda physics (Probably integrate `box2d`)
 - Sound. I hear it helps.

We'll be looking to prove the engine technology initially through a Halloween inspired mini game, hence the visuals. As such, we'll be putting out
the mini-game some time around Halloween itself (October 31st). Initially we're targeting Linux, but if time permits we'll port it to Android, too.
The tech demo will be available freely.

### And Then?

Well, once the first tech demo is in order, we'll pivot to development of the first *proper* title. Our art guy is working on things, dontchaknow.
In the mean time, if you want to see these things happen quicker, you have a couple of options:

 - [Contract us](/contact/) to develop your app/solution/infrastructure
 - Buy a [Game Raiser](/the-game-raiser/) Lifetime License
