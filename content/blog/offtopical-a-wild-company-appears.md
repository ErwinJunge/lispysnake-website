This is going to be a very short and sweet post, as it's been a real busy workday here at Lispy Snake HQ!
We had the pleasure of joining [{{<fontawesome fab fa-twitter>}} Gardiner Bryant](https://twitter.com/thelinuxgamer) as a guest on the Offtopical Podcast.
You can catch a short highlight version of it below, but be sure to check out [{{<fontawesome fab fa-youtube>}} The Linux Gamer](https://www.youtube.com/user/tuxreviews) and [{{<fontawesome fab fa-youtube>}} Off Topical Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgun4rxRBre1VHJgMlD8C0A) channels!

Our CEO, Ikey Doherty, discusses [The Game Raiser](/the-game-raiser/) campaign, as well as our vision, direction and immediate goals. Also, massive
spoiler alert for our first game specifics!

As you can see below, we've updated our shiny Game Raiser widget to reflect the number of licenses remaining. This is updated on a daily basis.
We thank everyone for their support of Indie Game Development, and specifically, our efforts here at Lispy Snake, Ltd.
