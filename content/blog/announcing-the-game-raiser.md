We're live! **Lispy Snake, Ltd.** is officially up and running. As part of our
startup strategy, we're launching _The Game Raiser_ campaign. This will allow
us to develop our open source engine and first game title quickly whilst retaining
independence from investors. The best part of that? You.<!--more-->

## The Campaign

We're selling *1,000* licenses that will give lifetime access to all of our
upcoming 2D titles. This will allow far quicker development of our game
engine and first title, as we won't need to rely on our internal reinvestment
cycle from our development contract work. Providing we hit our initial funding
target, we can avoid relying on private investors and retain independence,
whilst speeding up the timeline significantly.

We'll ensure frequent updates of the blog and provide demos as soon as possible.

## First Title

Our first game is helping us to build the engine in parallel. Right now, the game has no name, as we’re focusing more on the mechanics and story. Think, ‘Battlestar Galactica*’ meets ‘Homeworld*’ in an awesome 2D strategy-esque mashup. Dark storylines, heartbreaks and hope-crushers are the norm. The storyline will take precedence over visuals, taking you on a journey with our realistic, gritty characters as they face up to the human condition in new levels of isolation.
