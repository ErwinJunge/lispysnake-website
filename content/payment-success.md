# Thank you!

You should now receive a confirmation email from PayPal, verifying your
purchase. Please retain a copy for your records, as in future we'll
link that purchase to your license.

In future we'll allow user accounts on the website, which will automatically
enable access for your paypal email address for your lifetime license.

Additionally, you should receive a copy of your license key within the
next 24 hours. Currently we're manually assigning license keys to ensure
everyone is getting their key correctly.

If you have not received this key yet, and it's been more than 24 hours, please {{<fontawesome fas fa-envelope>}} [contact us](mailto:{{<param CompanyEmail>}}) to rectify this.

With your support, we all help to support the indie game development
market. Stay tuned for more blogposts and announcements in the near
future!
