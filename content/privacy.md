## Privacy Policy

At Lispy Snake, Ltd, we do not do anything to collect or process your personal information.
Our website is built using static technologies, including the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) generator.
As such, our website does not set or store any cookies on your machine.

Consequently, we do not have any access to your data. We do not track IPs or personal information
through our website or any services, and do not provide any facility to register or login.

Currently the only exception is our use of [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full) for [The Game Raiser](/the-game-raiser/) campaign.
Our use of your data is limited to allowing us to provide you with license access in our upcoming titles, and is currently entirely unprocessed.
As and when this changes, we will update our privacy policy in order to reflect the fact we will enable your PayPal transaction ID/details to be
used solely for the purposes of issuing a digital software license.

If you have any questions, or wish to discuss (in future) any retained data and the deletion thereof, please [email us](mailto:{{<param CompanyEmail>}}).
